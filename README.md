üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)
Follow these steps to set up and run the AgriPricePro application on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

pip (Python package installer)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd agripricepro-app

Step 2: Place Your Dataset
Ensure your Excel file, pricesofagriculture.xlsx, is located directly within the backend/ directory.

Important: The DATASET_PATH variable in backend/train_model.py is currently set to an absolute path (r'C:\Users\Bhiresh\Desktop\agripricepro\pricesofagriculture.xlsx'). For general GitHub usage, it is recommended to change this to a relative path if the file will always be in the backend/ folder:

DATASET_PATH = 'pricesofagriculture.xlsx'

Please adjust this in train_model.py after cloning/downloading for portability.

Step 3: Backend Setup (Python Environment)
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
This isolates your project's dependencies, ensuring a clean environment.

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

Your terminal prompt will typically show (venv) at the beginning once activated.

Install backend dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all necessary Python libraries (Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, Flask-CORS, etc.).

Train the ML model:
This script loads your dataset, performs preprocessing, trains the RandomForestRegressor pipeline, and saves the trained model (.pkl files) into the models/ directory. This step is crucial and must complete without errors.

python train_model.py

Step 4: Frontend Adjustments
Ensure your frontend/index.html includes <select> elements for District and Market within the prediction form. Your frontend/script.js should then be updated to:

Select these new dropdown elements by their IDs.

Add event listeners to populate District based on State selection, and Market based on District selection, utilizing the app_metadata object fetched from the backend.

Modify the predictBtn's click listener to send all relevant input parameters (crop_category, district, market, alongside existing ones) in the JSON payload to the backend's /api/predict endpoint.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
Start the Backend Server:

Open your terminal/command prompt.

Navigate to the backend/ directory.

Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

Run:

python app.py

You should see output similar to * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Keep this terminal window open.

Open the Frontend:

Navigate to the frontend/ directory in your file explorer.

Double-click index.html to open it in your preferred web browser.

The frontend will automatically establish communication with your running backend, populating dropdowns and enabling predictions.

üß† Machine Learning Model Explained
The core of AgriPricePro's prediction capability lies in its Random Forest Regressor model. This ensemble learning algorithm operates on the principle of "wisdom of the crowd."

Training Phase (train_model.py): The model is trained on your provided historical pricesofagriculture.xlsx dataset. Instead of learning a single set of rules, the RandomForestRegressor constructs multiple independent Decision Trees. Each tree is trained on a random subset of your data rows and considers only a random subset of features (e.g., Crop Type, Season, Rainfall, Previous Year Price) at each decision point. This randomization ensures diversity among the individual trees.

Prediction Phase (app.py): When a user requests a prediction, the input features (both user-selected and dynamically simulated values for environmental factors and historical context) are fed to every single trained Decision Tree within the Random Forest. Each tree independently generates its own price prediction. The final Average Price (INR/Quintal) displayed in the frontend is the average of all these individual predictions. This averaging process significantly improves robustness and generalization performance compared to a single decision tree.

Feature Integration: The model leverages comprehensive features from your dataset, including categorical inputs (one-hot encoded) and numerical features (standardized), to capture complex, non-linear relationships impacting crop prices.

üìà Scalability & Future Vision
This project is built with scalability in mind and lays the groundwork for advanced capabilities:

Real-time Data Integration: Future iterations can connect to live external APIs for up-to-the-minute weather, market, and production data, moving beyond current feature simulation.

Advanced Time-Series Forecasting: Explore and implement specialized time-series models (e.g., Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM neural networks) to provide more accurate and nuanced multi-step future price projections.

Model Interpretability (XAI): Integrate techniques to explain model decisions (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to highlight the most influential factors for each specific prediction.

Persistent User Data: Incorporate a cloud-based database (e.g., Google Firestore, AWS DynamoDB) for user authentication, saving prediction history, and personalized alert management.

Enhanced UI/UX: Develop more interactive dashboards, maps, and streamlined user workflows for a richer experience.

Containerization & Cloud Deployment: Utilize Docker for containerization and deploy the application to cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for production-level availability and automated scaling.
